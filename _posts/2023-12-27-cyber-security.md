## Introduction

Welcome to a deep dive into the world of cybersecurity! In this post, we'll embark on a journey exploring a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity â€“ scanning. Specifically, we'll conduct a basic scan using widely-used tools like Traceroute, Dig, and Nslookup. Scanning is a crucial step in identifying potential vulnerabilities and mapping network topologies, laying the foundation for robust cybersecurity practices.

## Background

Scanning, in the context of cybersecurity, involves the systematic exploration of a network to discover open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. Traceroute, Dig, and Nslookup are essential tools that aid security professionals in understanding the structure of a network and identifying potential weak points.

## Analysis

In our scanning activity, we aim to gather information about the target network, uncovering key details that can be critical for a security assessment. The analysis will involve examining the results of each scan, identifying any anomalies or unexpected findings, and interpreting the implications for the security posture of the network.

## Mitigations

Based on the insights gained from the scanning activity, we'll discuss potential mitigations to address identified vulnerabilities. Mitigations may include recommendations for securing open ports, implementing firewall rules, or applying patches to eliminate potential points of exploitation. This step is essential for enhancing the overall security posture of the network.

## Tools

### Traceroute

Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool that visually maps the route and measures transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It helps in identifying the devices (routers) along the path from the source to the destination.

### Dig

Dig (Domain Information Groper) is a command-line tool for querying DNS name servers. It is used to gather information about domain names, IP addresses, and DNS records, providing valuable insights into the domain's configuration.

### Nslookup

Nslookup (Name Server Lookup) is another command-line tool for querying DNS servers. It is particularly useful for troubleshooting and obtaining detailed information about DNS records associated with a domain.

These tools, when used collectively, offer a comprehensive view of the target network and facilitate a thorough scanning activity.
