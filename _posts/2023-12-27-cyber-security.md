## Scanning Activity

In this section, we'll perform a basic scanning activity using standard tools such as traceroute, dig, and nslookup. Scanning is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity that helps identify potential vulnerabilities and map network topologies.

### Traceroute Test

On Microsoft Windows:

tracert example.com

On Apple MAC OS X and Linux

traceroute example.com

Tracerout result i achieved on Microsoft windows Using CMD for'google.com'.
 
### Dig Test

dig example.com

Dig Results

- **Name Server Records:** ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com
- **MX Records:** mail.example.com
- **Time-to-Live (TTL):** TTL for records Z seconds
 
### Nslookup Test

'''bash

nslookup example.com

Nslookup Results

- **IP Address Mapping:** X.X.X.X
- **Reverse DNS Lookup:** example.com
- **Domain Information:** Registrar: ABC Registrar, Registered on Date

### Cross-Tool corelation

Correlating results from all three tools provided a comprehensive view of the network. Interesting findings and potential security concerns include:

- **Mismatched Information:** Inconsistencies in IP addresses or domain information across tools may indicate a misconfiguration or a potential security risk.
- **Unexpected Open Ports:** Ports identified by Traceroute that were not corroborated by Dig or Nslookup could be indicative of unauthorized services or devices.
- **Domain and IP Address Alignment:** Ensure that the domain's IP address and associated records align correctly to prevent DNS-related attacks.

### Mitigations

NOTE: These are general strategies that can help reduce the risk at each stage. Actual mitigations may vary based on specific details. Based on the insights gained from the scanning activity, we'll discuss potential mitigations to address identified vulnerabilities. Mitigations may include recommendations for securing open ports, implementing firewall rules, or applying patches to eliminate potential points of exploitation. This step is essential for enhancing the overall security posture of the network.


## SolarWinds Breach Case Study

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

In this section, we'll discuss Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and explore mitigation strategies.

Mitigations
Mitigations for DDoS attacks may include:

Traffic Filtering: Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to filter out malicious traffic.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Distribute content across multiple servers to handle traffic efficiently.
Load Balancing: Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload on a single server.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate-limiting measures to control the number of requests a server receives.

## Digitalization

Let's explore the impact of digitalization on cybersecurity.

Discussion
Digitalization brings numerous benefits but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. It is crucial to:

Implement robust encryption methods to protect sensitive data.
Regularly update and patch software to address vulnerabilities.
Foster a cybersecurity culture among employees through training and awareness programs.
Monitor network traffic for any unusual or suspicious activities.
