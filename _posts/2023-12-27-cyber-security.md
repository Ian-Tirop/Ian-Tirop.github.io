## Scanning Activity

In this section, we'll perform a basic scanning activity using standard tools such as traceroute, dig, and nslookup. Scanning is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity that helps identify potential vulnerabilities and map network topologies.

### Traceroute Test

Traceroute Results

- **Hop Count:** X hops
- **Latency:** Avg latency Y ms
- **Open Ports:**
  - Port 80: Open
  - Port 443: Open
 
### Dig Test

Dig Results

- **Name Server Records:** ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com
- **MX Records:** mail.example.com
- **Time-to-Live (TTL):** TTL for records Z seconds
 
### Nslookup Test

'''bash

nslookup example.com

Nslookup Results

- **IP Address Mapping:** X.X.X.X
- **Reverse DNS Lookup:** example.com
- **Domain Information:** Registrar: ABC Registrar, Registered on Date

  ## SolarWinds Breach Case Study

Let's dive into the SolarWinds breach case study based on the article by Temple-Raston (2021) and the Cyber Kill Chain model by Hutchins et al, 2011.

Cyber Kill Chain Analysis
Phases Identification
Create a table that analyzes the SolarWinds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain. Are there any phases that you cannot identify?

Cyber Kill Chain Phase:	Identified
1.Reconnaissance	        Yes
2.Weaponization	          Yes
3.Delivery	              Yes
4.Exploitation	          Yes
5.Installation	          Yes
6.Command and Control	    Yes
7.Actions on Objective	  Yes

Mitigations

Below is a list of possible mitigations for each phase.

Cyber Kill Chain Phase:	Possible Mitigations
1.Reconnaissance:	Security awareness training for employees, network monitoring.
2.Weaponization:	Email filtering, endpoint protection, threat intelligence.
3.Delivery:	Email filtering, web filtering, endpoint protection.
4.Exploitation:	Regular software patching, endpoint protection.
5.Installation:	User privilege management, endpoint protection.
6.Command and Control:	Network monitoring, intrusion detection systems.
7.Actions on Objective:	Incident response planning, data backup.

Tools and Reasons

The below tools were utilize in each phase following reasons for usage.

1.Reconnaissance: OSINT tools (e.g., Maltego) for gathering information about the target.
2.Weaponization: Email security tools to filter malicious attachments and links.
3.Delivery: Endpoint protection tools to detect and block malicious payloads.
4.Exploitation: Vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Nessus) to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
5.Installation: Identity and access management tools for user privilege management.
6.Command and Control: Network intrusion detection systems to identify and block suspicious network activities.
7.Actions on Objective: Incident response tools for timely and effective response.

DDOS Attack
In this section, we'll discuss Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and explore mitigation strategies.

Mitigations
Mitigations for DDoS attacks may include:

Traffic Filtering: Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to filter out malicious traffic.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Distribute content across multiple servers to handle traffic efficiently.
Load Balancing: Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload on a single server.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate-limiting measures to control the number of requests a server receives.
Digitalization
Let's explore the impact of digitalization on cybersecurity.

Discussion
Digitalization brings numerous benefits but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. It is crucial to:

Implement robust encryption methods to protect sensitive data.
Regularly update and patch software to address vulnerabilities.
Foster a cybersecurity culture among employees through training and awareness programs.
Monitor network traffic for any unusual or suspicious activities.
Conclusion
This post has explored various aspects of cybersecurity, including scanning activities, a case study on the SolarWinds breach, DDoS attacks, and the impact of digitalization. Stay tuned for more insights into the dynamic and evolving field of cybersecurity!
